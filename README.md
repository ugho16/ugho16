## Hello there!

I'm Paolo Martinoli, but most of my friends call me Ugo because - they say - I have the voice of someone called Ugo. I added an H to be sure I was the only one with this name, and that explains my weird username. :sweat_smile:

Here's something more about me:

- :soccer: Super fan of [Inter](https://www.inter.it)
- :mountain: Mountain lover
- :books: Literature passionate
- :european_castle: Medievalist

## What I do

I am a Technical Writer based in Milan :it:, and I am currently working at [Worldline](https://github.com/worldline) as a Documentation Specialist. I am also a reviewer of the Italian localization team of the [CNCF Glossary](https://github.com/cncf/glossary).

Here you can find a [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/xK0dQI1gqoE?feature=share) (in :it:) where I explain how to contribute to CNCF Glossary!
