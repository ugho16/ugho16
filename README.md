## Hello there!

I'm Paolo Martinoli, but most of my friends call me Ugo because - they say - I have the voice of someone called Ugo. I added an H to be sure I aws the only one with this name, and that's explain my weird username. :sweat_smile:

Here's something more about me:

- :soccer: Super fan of [Inter](https://www.inter.it)
- :mountain: Mountain lover
- :books: Literature passionate
- :european_castle: Medievalist

## What I do

I am a Technical Writer based in Milan :it:, and I am currently working at [Mia-Platform](https://github.com/mia-platform). I am also part of the team of [RÃ¶nd](https://github.com/rond-authz) and a reviewer of the Italian localization of the [CNCF Glossary](https://github.com/cncf/glossary).
